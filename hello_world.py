#here we are going to learn about strings

"hello" #method to write string is adding it in double quotes

name = "Raj" #storing string in variable 
print(type(name))

#message = "John said to me "I will see you later"" will give you error
message = 'John said to me "I will see you later"' #way to avoid string breaking
print(message)

#triple single or double quotes are used to print single paragraph with same concatination
